## Homebrew

Install:
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Check version:
```
brew --version
```


## Zsh
[ZSH](http://www.zsh.org/) is a shell designed for interactive use, although it is also a powerful scripting language.

Install:
```
brew install zsh
```

Check version:
```
zsh --version
```

Switch from bash to zsh:
```
sudo sh -c "echo $(which zsh) >> /etc/shells"

chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

Open new terminal and check (it is suppose to show `/bin/zsh`):
```
echo $SHELL
```

## Oh My Zsh

## ctags
[ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) generates an index (or tag) file of language objects found in source files that allows these items to be quickly and easily located by a text editor or other utility.
